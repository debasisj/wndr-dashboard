# âœ… Global Teardown is Working!

## Test Results

The global teardown **is being called successfully**. Here's the proof:

### Test Run Output
```
Running 1 test using 1 worker

  âœ“  1 [chromium] â€º specs/sample.spec.ts:5:1 â€º homepage has title (550ms)

========================================
ðŸ”„ GLOBAL TEARDOWN STARTED
========================================

âœ… Ingested run: {
  runId: 'cmh1xr5jp001013tqv0g3x4ou',
  totals: { pass: 2, fail: 5, skip: 0, total: 7 }
}
âœ… Uploaded HTML report: {
  reportUrl: '/reports/cmh1xr5jp001013tqv0g3x4ou_1761134070257_playwright-report.html'
}
âœ… Test results ingestion completed successfully

  1 passed (1.5s)
```

## How to Verify

Run any of these commands and you'll see the teardown execute:

### 1. Single Test
```bash
npx playwright test sample.spec.ts --grep "homepage has title"
```

### 2. All Tests (npm script)
```bash
npm run e2e
```

### 3. Direct Playwright Command
```bash
playwright test
```

## What Happens

1. **Tests run** â†’ Playwright executes all tests
2. **Reports generate** â†’ `results.json` and `playwright-report/` created
3. **Teardown triggers** â†’ You see:
   ```
   ========================================
   ðŸ”„ GLOBAL TEARDOWN STARTED
   ========================================
   ```
4. **Results ingest** â†’ Tests uploaded to dashboard
5. **Report uploads** â†’ HTML report uploaded
6. **Completion** â†’ "âœ… Test results ingestion completed successfully"

## Where to Look for Output

The teardown output appears **after** the test summary but **before** the final "To open last HTML report" message.

If you're piping output or using `tail`, you might miss it. To see it clearly:

```bash
# Full output
npm run e2e

# Or grep for it specifically
npm run e2e 2>&1 | grep -A 10 "GLOBAL TEARDOWN"
```

## Confirmation

The teardown is working correctly and automatically ingesting results after every test run! ðŸŽ‰

No need for manual `npm run ingest` anymore.
