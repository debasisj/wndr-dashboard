## Files Created/Modified

### Created
1. `scripts/build-multiplatform.sh` - Automated multi-platform build script
2. `DOCKER_HUB_MULTIPLATFORM.md` - Comprehensive multi-platform documentation
3. `MULTIPLATFORM_FIX.md` - Quick reference for platform issues

### Modified
1. `README.md` - Updated with multi-platform information

## Key Benefits

1. **Clearer Platform Support**: Users immediately know the images work on their platform
2. **Better Troubleshooting**: Platform errors are now documented with solutions
3. **Contributor Guidance**: Clear instructions for building multi-platform images
4. **Professional Documentation**: Comprehensive coverage of deployment options

## Next Steps

After the multi-platform build completes:
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Update Docker Hub descriptions to mention multi-platform support
3. Test deployment on both ARM64 and AMD64 platforms
4. Update any external documentation or blog posts

## Verification

To verify the updates are working:

```bash
# 1. Check that images are multi-platform
docker buildx imagetools inspect debasisj/wndr-dashboard-api:latest
docker buildx imagetools inspect debasisj/wndr-dashboard-web:latest

# 2. Test deployment on different platforms
# On ARM64 Mac
docker pull debasisj/wndr-dashboard-api:latest

# On AMD64 (EC2/Intel Mac)
docker pull debasisj/wndr-dashboard-api:latest

# 3. Verify README renders correctly on GitHub
# Check that all links work
# Verify code blocks format properly
```
